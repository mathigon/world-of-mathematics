This chapter, on the other hand, is about games where there is no &#8216;luck&#8217; involved: these games are called <strong>Combinatorial Games</strong>.</p><p>One example of a combinatorial game is chess, but it is so complex, with so many different moves and positions, that it is almost impossible to analyse chess using the methods we will develop throughout this chapter. Here is an example of a much simpler game:</p><blockquote><div class="rbox"><img src="resources/Game_Theory/choc_box.jpg" width="350" height="216" alt="box of chocolates"></div><p><em>There are two boxes with chocolates, and two players eat them alternatingly. At each turn, a player has to eat one or more chocolates, but only from one box at a time. For example, a player could eat three chocolates from box A, but not one from box A and one from box B.</em></p><p><em>Both players continue, alternatingly eating chocolates, until both boxes are empty. Whoever gets the last chocolate wins.</em></p></blockquote><p>Here you can try playing this game against the computer. Start by clicking on all the chocolates you want to eat, then click the button to end your turn.</p><div id="choc_1_wrap"><div class="choc_box shadow on" id="choc_1_1"><table border=""><tr><td class="choc ch_1">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_2">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="choc ch_4">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_5">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_6">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="choc ch_7">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_8">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_9">&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div><div class="choc_box shadow on" id="choc_1_2"><table border=""><tr><td class="choc ch_1">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_2">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="choc ch_4">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_5">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_6">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="choc ch_7">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_8">&nbsp;</td><td class="choc ch_9">&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div><p class="center"><span id="chocButton" class="button">Click to end your turn</span></p></div><p>After some time you may notice that you always lose. In fact, it it clear from the beginning that the computer always wins unless it makes a mistake. <span class="lgrey">(And computers never make mistakes&#8230;)</span> The following sections will explore different methods to analyse combinatorial games, to find <em>winning strategies</em> and to determine whether it is better to go first or to go second.</p><p class="lgrey">If you have already noticed a pattern and worked out a winning strategy, the following sections may seem rather complicated for solving a simple game. However the same methods can them be applied to much more complex games.</p><h2>Tree Diagrams</h2><p>One method to think about combinatorial games is to make a list of all possible outcomes. This is best done in a <em>tree diagram</em>, where every fork shows all possible choices a player could make. Here is the tree diagram for a slightly simpler version of the game above, with only three chocolates per box.</p><div class="box emptyCaption" id="GamesSlide1"><div class="boxTitle">Tree Diagram</div><div id="GamesSlide1Wrap"><img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_0" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s02.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 1; position: static"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_6" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s07.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_7" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s08.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_8" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s09.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_9" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s10.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_10" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s11.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_11" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s12.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_12" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s13.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_13" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s14.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_14" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s15.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_1" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s01.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 1"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_2" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s03.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_3" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s04.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_4" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s05.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_1_5" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides1/s06.png" width="670" height="550" alt="" style="opacity: 0"></div><div class="boxCaption frame slideshowCaption"><div class="slideshowLeft off"></div><div class="slideshowText"><p class="on">Whoever empties the first box loses, because the opponent can empty the other box, thereby taking the last chocolate. Therefore <strong class="green">Player 1</strong> only has two sensible choices: taking one or taking two chocolates from one box.</p><p>Now it&#8217;s <span class="lblue"><strong>Player 2</strong></span>&#8217;s turn. <span class="lblue"><strong>Player 2</strong></span> also doesn&#8217;t want to empty any box. This means there are two possibilities in one case, and three in the other.</p><p>It&#8217;s <span class="green"><strong>Player 1</strong></span>&#8217;s turn. With fewer chocolates left there are much fewer possibilities that don&#8217;t involve emptying the first box, which would lead to certain loss.</p><p>We continue: if there is one chocolate in both boxes, one player has to empty the first box. The opponent can then take the last chocolate from the second box and wins.</p><p>Let us highlight the final positions in which <span class="green"><strong>Player 1</strong></span> and <span class="lblue"><strong>Player 2</strong></span> win.</p><p>So far the game seems quite fair: there are three winning positions for each player. Now let us think about the positions second from last.</p><p>Once we have arrived at any of these positions we already know who is going to win. If you can only go to a winning position for <strong class="green">Player 1</strong>, this also has to be a winning position for <strong class="green">Player 1</strong>. And the same is true for <span class="lblue"><strong>Player 2</strong></span>. We can colour the positions second from last according to which winning position they lead to.</p><p>And we can do the same again: whenever we can only go to winning positions of one kind, we colour the previous position in the same colour.</p><p>Unfortunately we will get stuck at some point&#8230;</p><p>When at these two positions there is a choice: we could either go to a winning position for <strong><span class="green">Player 1</span></strong> or to a winning position for <strong><span class="lblue">Player 2</span></strong>. Here we have to make an assumption that both players are intelligent and will play in their best interest. If it is <strong><span class="green">Player 1</span></strong>&#8217;s turn he/she will of course go to his/her own winning position and the same for <strong><span class="lblue">Player 2</span></strong>.</p><p>We have coloured the first case <span class="lblue"><strong>blue</strong></span> because <span class="lblue"><strong>Player 2</strong></span> has a choice to go to his/her own winning position. The second case is coloured <span class="green"><strong>green</strong></span> because <span class="green"><strong>Player 1</strong></span> has a choice to go to his/her own winning position. These are the positions where players have to be careful not to make a mistake.</p><p>The same is happens here: <span class="lblue"><strong>Player 2</strong></span> has the option to go to <span class="lblue"><strong>blue</strong></span> and <span class="green"><strong>green</strong></span> winning positions, but &#8211; if he plays intelligently &#8211; he/she will of course choose <span class="lblue"><strong>blue</strong></span>.</p><p>It seems that whatever <strong class="green">Player 1</strong> does on the first turn, he/she will always end up on a winning position for <span class="lblue"><strong>Player 2</strong></span>.</p><p><span class="lblue"><strong>Player 2</strong></span> is destined to win from the beginning &#8211; unless he makes a mistake.</p></div><div class="slideshowRight"></div></div></div><p>This method is useful for simple games, but impractical if we have boxes with many more chocolates. If there are five chocolates per box, we would have to consider more than 10,000 possibilities!</p><h2><em>P</em> and <em>N</em>-Positions</h2><p>In the tree diagram above we had many copies of the same state in different branches of the tree. Instead let us draw a diagram of all the different states, and connect two states with an arrow if a player could move from one to the other. (Remember that you can&#8217;t put chocolates back or take chocolates from more than one box.)</p><p>We will again highlight various states with different colours, but the colours will have a different meaning than above.</p><div class="box emptyCaption" id="GamesSlide2"><div class="boxTitle"><em>P</em> and <em>N</em> Positions Diagram</div><div id="GamesSlide2Wrap"><img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_3" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s03.png" width="450" height="450" alt="" style="opacity: 0; position: static"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_4" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s04.png" width="450" height="450" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_5" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s05.png" width="450" height="450" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_6" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s06.png" width="450" height="450" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_7" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s07.png" width="450" height="450" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_8" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s08.png" width="450" height="450" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_9" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s09.png" width="450" height="450" alt="" style="opacity: 0"> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_1" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s01.png" width="450" height="450" alt=""> <img class="choc_sl2" id="c_2_2" src="resources/Game_Theory/slides2/s02.png" width="450" height="450" alt="" style="opacity: 0"></div><div class="boxCaption frame slideshowCaption"><div class="slideshowLeft off"></div><div class="slideshowText"><p class="on">Here you can see all possible states of the game we were playing.</p><p>These arrows show the possible moving directions.

All the other positions are <span class="red"><em><strong>N</strong></em>-position</span>. And this extends to bigger box sizes, including nine chocolates per box like in the game at the beginning of this article.

If you are unlucky and you are the player destined to lose, there is nothing you can do except hope that your opponent makes a mistake&#8230;</p><h2>The Game of Nim</h2><p>The game we have been thinking about is a variant of <strong>Nim</strong>. The winning strategy for only two boxes of chocolates is easy to find, but things get more interesting when we have three or more boxes. Instead of boxes of chocolates we will simply use piles of counters: you are allowed to take as many counters as you want, but only from one pile at a time. We can denote the various states of the game using numbers: for example, (2,5,4) means there are three piles with 2, 5 and 4 counters respectively.</p><div class="box"><div id="NimWon" class="off">Congratulations, you won!</div><div id="NimLost" class="off">Game over&#8230; Try again!</div><table id="NimTable" class="tableSmall"></table><div class="caption frame"><div class="frameTextWrap" style="padding: 10px"><p style="margin: 0"><input id="NimText" value="(4,5,3,2)"><input type="button" id="NimButton" class="button" value="Restart"></p></div></div></div><p>Notice that it doesn&#8217;t matter which order the piles are in, or whether there are additional piles with zero counters. For example, (2,5,4) = (5,0,4,2). We have already shown that (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), &#8230; are all <em><strong>P</strong></em>-positions, and there is a simple method for determining whether positions with three or more piles are <em><strong>P</strong></em> or <em><strong>N</strong></em>. <span class="lgrey">This method may seem quite unexpected and unrelated to game theory. It arises when you analyse <em><strong>P</strong></em> and <em><strong>N</strong></em>-positions mathematically.</span></p><blockquote style="margin: 1.5em 2.5em"><p>A Nim state (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, &#8230;) is a <strong><em>P</em></strong>-position if the <em>binary digital sum</em> or <em>Nim sum</em> of <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, &#8230; is 0. Otherwise it is a <em><strong>N</strong></em>-position. The Nim sum is often written as <em>a</em> &oplus; <em>b</em> &oplus;<em>c</em> &oplus; &#8230; and can be calculates as shown in the following example.</p><p>To find the Nim sum 3 &oplus; 6 &oplus; 7 we proceed as follows:</p><div class="box" id="NimSlideshow" style="margin: 1em 0"><table width="250" border="" id="nimtab" class="tableSmall tableFixed" style="width: 250px"><tr id="row0"><td class="td_right td_bottom">&nbsp;</td><td class="td_bottom">4</td><td class="td_bottom">2</td><td class="td_bottom">1</td></tr><tr id="row1"><td class="col0 td_right">3</td><td class="col3">0</td><td class="col2">1</td><td class="col1">1</td></tr><tr id="row2"><td class="col0 td_right">6</td><td class="col3">1</td><td class="col2">1</td><td class="col1">0</td></tr><tr id="row3"><td class="col0 td_right td_bottom col0">7</td><td class="col3 td_bottom">1</td><td class="col2 td_bottom">1</td><td class="col1 td_bottom">1</td></tr><tr id="row4"><td class="colx td_right">2</td><td class="col3">0</td><td class="col2">1</td><td class="col1">0</td></tr></table><div class="boxCaption frame slideshowCaption"><div class="slideshowLeft off"></div><div class="slideshowText"><p class="on">Above you can see the three numbers <strong class="red">3</strong>, <strong class="red">6</strong> and <strong class="red">7</strong> in different rows and powers of 2 (<strong class="blue">1</strong>, <strong class="blue">2</strong>, <strong class="blue">4</strong>, 8, &#8230;) in different columns. We first need to write 3, 6 and 7 in <a href="Coding_and_Cryptography">binary</a>, which means writing them as a sum of powers of 2.</p><p>Note that <strong class="green">3 = 1 + 2</strong>.

Since the Nim sum is not 0, the Nim state (3,6,7) is a <em><strong>N</strong></em>-position. Removing two counters from any pile will make the Nim sum 0, so this would represent moving to a <em><strong>P</strong></em>-position.</p></div><div class="slideshowRight"></div></div></div></blockquote><p>Nim has several important properties:</p><ul class="list"><li>Exactly two opponents move alternately.</li><li>The moves and all options are clearly specified by rules, and there are no chance moves.</li><li>There are only finitely many different positions and the game will always come to an end when one player is unable to move. This means that there are no draws and no cycles, which could repeat forever.</li><li>The players have perfect information. Card games often don&#8217;t have perfect information because one player doesn&#8217;t know the opponents&#8217; cards.</li><li>From any one position of the game both players have the same choice of moves. This is not true for chess, because from any particular position, one player can only move white figures and the opponent can only move black ones.</li></ul><p>Games with all these properties are called <strong>Impartial Games</strong>. Mathematicians discovered that <em>any</em> impartial game is equivalent to a game of Nim with certain box sizes. This means that the <em><strong>P</strong></em> and <em><strong>N</strong></em>-positions match up, and that there are always the same number of possible moves. A winning strategy for any impartial game can be found by converting it into Nim and then using the Nim sum.</p><a class="ibox frame box" href="http://www.mathigon.org/world/resources/Game_Theory/Combinatoial_Game_Theory.pdf"><img src="resources/Game_Theory/i-games.jpg" width="90" height="60"> Article on Combinatorial Game Theory<br><span class="caption">Presented by Philipp Legner at the "Tomorrow's Mathematician's Today" Conference</span></a><h2>Non-Combinatorial Games</h2><div class="rbox"><img class="shadow" src="resources/Game_Theory/chess.jpg" width="350" height="235" alt="chess"><p class="caption">One of the most captivating combinatorial games: chess</p></div><p>Impartial games are interesting to analyse from a mathematical point of view, but once you have found a winning strategy they are not particularly exciting to play &#8211; you know right from the beginning who is going to win.</p><p>There are many other combinatorial games.

Both prisoners are promised to get away if they betray their accomplice, who will gets the full sentence of 10 years.</p><p>If both prisoners stay silent, there is not enough evidence so both get a shorter sentence of 1 year. If both betray each other, each is sentenced to 5 years in prison.</p><p>The following table shows the four possible outcomes, depending on the actions of <span class="red"><strong>Prisoner A</strong></span> and <span class="blue"><strong>Prisoner B</strong></span>:</p><table width="350" border=""><tr><td class="td_right td_bottom">&nbsp;</td><td class="td_bottom red"><strong>Prisoner A betrays</strong></td><td class="td_bottom red"><strong>Prisoner A stays silent</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="blue td_right"><strong>Prisoner B betrays</strong></td><td><span class="red">A: 5 years</span><br><span class="blue">B: 5 years</span></td><td><span class="red">A: 10 years</span><br><span class="blue">B goes free</span></td></tr><tr><td class="blue td_right"><strong>Prisoner B stays silent</strong></td><td><span class="red">A goes free</span><br><span class="blue">B: 10 years</span></td><td><span class="red">A: 1 year</span><br><span class="blue">B: 1 year</span></td></tr></table><p>Let us suppose we were <span class="red"><strong>Prisoner A</strong></span> and thinking about which action to take: betraying of staying silent.</p><ul class="list"><li>If we knew <span class="blue"><strong>Prisoner B</strong></span> would betray us (first row), betraying would get us 5 years while staying silent would get us 10 years. Thus we should also betray.</li><li>If we knew <span class="blue"><strong>Prisoner B</strong></span> would stay silent (second row), betraying would get us 0 years while staying silent would get us 1 year.

Both prisoners will betray each other and will both be sentenced to 5 years in jail.</p><p>Notice, however, that if they had <em>cooperated</em> and both stayed silent, they would have managed to force an outcome that would have been better for <em>both of them</em>: just one year each.</p></div></div><div class="boxWrap"><div class="boxTextWrap"><div class="rbox" style="margin-bottom: 0"><img src="resources/Game_Theory/nash.jpg" width="200" height="240" alt="John Nash" class="shadow"><p class="caption">John Forbes Nash (* 1928)</p></div><p>In the Prisoners dilemma, the position (A betrays, B betrays) is called a <strong>Nash equilibrium</strong>: no individual player can improve his/her outcome by changing their strategy.</p><p>In 1951, the mathematician John Forbes Nash (* 1928) proved that all &#8220;games&#8221; of this kind have Nash equilibria (but there can be more than one). These are not necessarily the best outcome for all players <span class="lgrey">(see the Prisoners dilemma)</span>, but they are the choices which players will end up making.</p><p>John Nash was jointly awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work, and his biography is depicted in the Academy Award winning movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/">A Beautiful Mind</a>.</p><p>Nash equilibria are of fundamental importance when analysing economic behaviour like that of big companies, as well as wars, arms races or even soccer games. In all these cases, we have to make a decision, taking into account the decisions our opponent(s) could make.</p><div class="clear"></div></div></div><div class="boxWrap"><div class="boxTextWrap"><p>Here is another famous problem in game theory: decision making in marriage.</p><blockquote><p><em>A couple decides to go out after work. They either go to the Opera (which the wife prefers) or to a football match (which the husband prefers). Their phones are broken and they cannot contact each other where to go.</em></p><p class="centre"><img src="resources/Game_Theory/opera.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="opera" class="shadow"> &nbsp;or&nbsp; <img src="resources/Game_Theory/stadium.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="stadium" class="shadow"> &nbsp;?</p></blockquote><p>The following table shows their respective &#8220;gains&#8221;. If both go to different places, their gain is 0. If they go to the same place, their gain is either 2 or 3, depending on whether they went to their preferred location or not. (The <em>gain</em> is often called the <em>utility function</em>.)</p><table width="400" border=""><tr><td class="td_right td_bottom">&nbsp;</td><td class="td_bottom red"><strong>Wife goes to Opera</strong></td><td class="td_bottom red"><strong>Wife goes to Stadium</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="blue td_right"><strong>Husband goes to Opera</strong></td><td><span class="red">W: 3</span><br><span class="blue">H: 2</span></td><td><span class="red">W: 0</span><br><span class="blue">H: 0</span></td></tr><tr><td class="blue td_right"><strong>Husband goes to Stadium</strong></td><td><span class="red">W: 0</span><br><span class="blue">H: 0</span></td><td><span class="red">W: 2</span><br><span class="blue">H: 3</span></td></tr></table><p>In this case there are <em>two</em> Nash equilibria: <em>both going to the opera</em> or <em>both going to the stadium</em>. This means that it is much harder to make a decision, often involving psychology and behavioural science (not just mathematics).</p><p>If we repeat this &#8220;experiment&#8221; many times we would observe that husband and wife don&#8217;t have a <em>fixed strategy</em> of going to a particular place, but that they employ a <em>mixed strategy</em>: both go to each location with a certain probability.</p><p class="lgrey">In this example you can calculate that, optimally, the husband goes to the stadium with probability 3/5 and to the opera with probability 2/5. For the wife, these numbers are swapped.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="bottomBar"></div></article><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="scripts/jquery-203.js"><\/script>')</script><script src="/scripts/layout.min.js?v=4"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinit.js"></script><script>window.ga = window.ga || function() { (ga.q = ga.q||[]).push(arguments) }; ga.l = 1 * new Date();
